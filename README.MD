d-nanomsg
=========
* experimental d-lang bindings for nano msg framework (a successor to ZeroMQ written in C) (nanomsg-0.6-beta)

* see [dlang.org](dlang.org) for more about the D Programming Language

* Ported to Dlang (2014) by Laeeth Isharc.  Caveat emptor.

* Examples are from [dysinger](https://github.com/dysinger/nanomsg-examples/blob/master/README.org)
    - I have added one more example: filesend.d that demonstrates sending a text file

Please be aware that this is something like pre-alpha readiness; it was written in a hurry and may not be of outstanding quality.  The tiny examples do all compile and seem to work correctly and I use some of the patterns in production.

I have not tested on Windows, and don't plan on maintaining a Windows version for the time being.  Anyone with the inclination and more time is welcome to help.
