d-nanomsg
=========
* experimental dlang bindings for nano msg framework (a successor to ZeroMQ written in C) (nanomsg-1.0)

* see [dlang.org](dlang.org) for more about the D Programming Language

* Ported to Dlang (2014,2015,2016) by Laeeth Isharc.  Caveat emptor.

* Examples are from [dysinger](https://github.com/dysinger/nanomsg-examples/blob/master/README.org)
    - I have added one more example: filesend.d that demonstrates sending a text file
