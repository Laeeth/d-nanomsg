2)  EXAMPLE CODE FROM DYSINGER
    https://github.com/dysinger/nanomsg-examples/blob/master/README.org

    No license is mentioned, but implicitly I believe it is acceptable to port these.  I
    have checked with the author and will update when i hear back.

3)  BINDINGS THEMSELVES
    Not an original work since it is the hacked-up set of headers from nanomsg.  But to the
    extent it is an original work then I release these changes under the same license as applies
    to the nanomsg main project.  I would be grateful though if you would let me know if you use this
    work in the financial area (just to satisfy my curiosity).

    Please email me laeeth-nospam@nospam-laeeth.com if any questions (but understand that
    on occasion it may be a few weeks before I am able to respond).
